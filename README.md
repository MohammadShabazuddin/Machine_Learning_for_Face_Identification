# 🌟 Facial Recognition Project 🌟

Welcome to our Facial Recognition Project! This project utilizes Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for accurate face identification. 🤖✨

## 📋 Project Overview

The facial recognition project is built with Python and employs the following key technologies:

- SVM for classification
- PCA for dimensionality reduction
- Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset
- RandomizedSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning

## 🚀 Features

- SVM-based facial recognition
- PCA-based dimensionality reduction
- Fine-tuned SVM hyperparameters using RandomizedSearchCV
- Visualizations: Eigenfaces, Confusion Matrix, and Predicted vs. True Faces Gallery

## 🛠️ Setup and Usage

1. Install the required dependencies: `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`
2. Run the Python script: `python facial_recognition_project.py`

## 📊 Results

- Achieved effective facial recognition on the LFW dataset
- Demonstrated the power of SVM and PCA in real-world applications
